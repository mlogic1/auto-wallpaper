### TODO List
| Item			|Description	|
| ------------- |-------------	|
| Logging cleanup      | Implement some sort of logging cleanup (possibly when the log is larger than 1MB?) Currently the application never cleans up the log file |
| System icon   | Update the application icon to a nicer one. Current is just a placeholder      |
| Windows 10/11 right click menu | Update the right click menu to have a more modern look and feel similar to Windows 10 / 11 rather than the classic rectanglular design |
